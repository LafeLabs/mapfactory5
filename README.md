## What is organic media?

Organic in this case means "like a living thing".

Properties of organic media:

- self replicating
- can be deleted
- can be improved/evolved
- can self-repair
- self-contained, but in equilibrium with its environment
- systems tend to contain smaller systems that repeat patterns
