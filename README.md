[link back to map](index.html)

## This is the Map Factory.

A "map" in this context is a general type of computer file which consists of a stack of ordered elements in a web browser.  These elements might be images, symbols, boxes of text, or links.  Images may also be links.  The elements are in a "stack" in the sense that they are placed in order in the browser, so higher ones are on top of lower ones.  

The symbol for a map is 

![](iconsymbols/navigator.svg).  Click on that link from this screen to get back to the map.

To edit this file, click on the "edit" icon, which looks like this:

![](iconsymbols/editor.svg)

The icon for scroll gets you to this page, and looks like this:

![](iconsymbols/scrollicon.svg)

Maps are edited from the main page by clicking the edit icon from there.  When in edit mode there are buttons that move you through the various elements in the stack that makes up the map, and those buttons look like this:

![](iconsymbols/nextbutton.svg)![](iconsymbols/prevbutton.svg)

Layers can be alternated one for the other using the swap up and swap down buttons:

![](iconsymbols/movedownbutton.svg)![](iconsymbols/moveupbutton.svg)

SAVE!!! SAVE OFTEN!!  Save the current map by clicking the "save" icon which looks like this:


![](iconsymbols/savebutton.svg)

To delete an element hit the big red "X", and BE CAREFUL!! Here is the "delete" icon:

![](iconsymbols/deletebutton.svg)

To create a new element which is a clone of the current one, click the new element icon which looks like this:

![](iconsymbols/newbutton.svg)

The table with the three fields "text", "href" and "src" define the text of the element, the address the link points to if it is a link, and the address of the image if is an image.  Local images can be uploaded by clicking on the upload browse and upload buttons and following the prompts.   Those images, along with symbols in the "symbols" directory can be clicked on to insert them into the currently active element in the stack.  

Position of an element can be changed by dragging around on the screen with a touch screen or mouse.  Size and angle can be changed with a touch screen by sliding a finger along the scale and rotation bars.  Without a touch screen the zoom and rotate buttons do the same thing.  This system can be awkward to navigate on mobile devices.  If you know CSS and want to repair that please do and help fix this and fork the project accordingly, and let me know.
