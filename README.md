## This is the Map Factory.

A "map" in this context is a general type of computer file which consists of a stack of ordered elements in a web browser.  These elements might be images, symbols, boxes of text, or links.  Images may also be links.  The elements are in a "stack" in the sense that they are placed in order in the browser, so higher ones are on top of lower ones.  

The symbol for a map is 

![](iconsymbols/navigator.svg).  Click on that link from this screen to get back to the map.

To edit this file, click on the "edit" icon, which looks like this:

![](iconsymbols/editor.svg)

The icon for scroll gets you to this page, and looks like this:

![](iconsymbols/scrollicon.svg)

Maps are edited from the main page by clicking the edit icon from there.  When in edit mode there are buttons that move you through the various elements in the stack that makes up the map, and those buttons look like this:

![](iconsymbols/nextbutton.svg)![](iconsymbols/prevbutton.svg)

Layers can be alternated one for the other using the swap up and swap down buttons:

![](iconsymbols/movedownbutton.svg)![](iconsymbols/moveupbutton.svg)

SAVE!!! SAVE OFTEN!!  Save the current map by clicking the "save" icon which looks like this:


![](iconsymbols/savebutton.svg)

To delete an element hit the big red "X", and BE CAREFUL!! Here is the "delete" icon:

![](iconsymbols/deletebutton.svg)

To create a new element which is a clone of the current one, click the new element icon which looks like this:

![](iconsymbols/newbutton.svg)

The table with the three fields "text", "href" and "src" define the text of the element, the address the link points to if it is a link, and the address of the image if is an image.  Local images can be uploaded by clicking on the upload browse and upload buttons and following the prompts.   Those images, along with symbols in the "symbols" directory can be clicked on to insert them into the currently active element in the stack.  

Position of an element can be changed by dragging around on the screen with a touch screen or mouse.  Size and angle can be changed with a touch screen by sliding a finger along the scale and rotation bars.  Without a touch screen the zoom and rotate buttons do the same thing.  This system can be awkward to navigate on mobile devices.  If you know CSS and want to repair that please do and help fix this and fork the project accordingly, and let me know.  


All this is just a dry description of what this is.  But what is it for?  Many things! For one thing, the type of file called a "meme" on the Internet, that is an image with some text over it, can be made very rapidly with this system, and then edited and shared.  Without using any local software on your computer like the Adobe suite or other image editors, you can create not just images with text on them but images with other images and vector graphics symbols on them.  The map factory can be combined with symbol factories(documented elsewhere) in this system which make symbols which can be overlaid on top of images or each other.  The ability to place symbols such as arrows or circles easily on an image is incredibly powerful.  With images with arrows on them, we can hide things and show where they are, and with links and sequences of maps this can go from a map of all of Earth down to a geographic region, city, street, block, view of a location, bush, rock, and finally tiny hiding place, all with this format which can be edited on the fly on a mobile device anonymously. 

Also sequences of these maps can behave like PowerPoint or other types of presentation slide decks like that but with a more generalized format that allows for them to be linked to each other in a non linear graph across the whole Web.

The word "map" is meant in a very general sense.  One definition is "a diagram or other visual representation that shows the relative position of the parts of something".  Mathematicians use "map" to describe how functions transform elements of one set to another, which in a web page might imply links to other pages.  But the geographic definition is never far from our minds.  A very basic function of this system is to rapidly go from the literal maps that we find in existing map software or physical paper maps(which you can photograph on your phone and upload) to the conceptual maps that are more useful in our minds, including important locations for some purpose such as a specific type of business or tourist destination, or accessible public restrooms.  As always in the Geometron system, we seek to build not just a map but a general class of methodologies for building maps which replicates to more maps and more makers of maps.  

To edit all the underlying code of the system click on the following link:

[code editor](editor.php)

To replicate the system, read the "page" replicator documentation and replicate this the same way.  To make a new page with a page replicator, go to [pagelist.php](pagelist.php) and make a new page, which will automatically have the scroll describing how it is replicated.  You can also use pagelist link to create other elements of the Geometron system: symbol factory and technical paper.
